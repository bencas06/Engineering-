    This week was cool we learned about simple machines,
    safety rules, and used tinkercad to 3d design.
    The modeling was full of mixed emotions since I couldn't get the design I wanted
    all the time but it was fun. In the beginning of the week we went over safety rules
    and now I know what is needed to be safe in engineering. Learning about simple machines was 
    interesting too seeing that we use these machines all the time.
    This week was pretty cool.
