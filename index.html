    Week 2:This week was cool we learned about simple machines,
    safety rules, and used tinkercad to 3d design.
    The modeling was full of mixed emotions since I couldn't get the design I wanted
    all the time but it was fun. In the beginning of the week we went over safety rules
    and now I know what is needed to be safe in engineering. Learning about simple machines was 
    interesting too seeing that we use these machines all the time.
    This week was pretty cool.

    Week 3:This week was short but we did a challenge. The challenge was to make an E and label with measurement.
    Then we would swap papers with someone and trace out their E. Some of the E's in the class were really big but some were small. 
    It was the only major thing we did since the week was short but it was interesting.

Week 4:This week was spent building our rude goldberg machine. We acomplished a good amount of work. We didnt finish but
we will be finished soon. We also had a challenge this week. The challenge was to make a boat and have it float while having the most weight to win.
We all made our own designs and decided which boat to use. My teams boat did not stay a float for long our lasted for atleast 30 seconds.

Week 5: This week we had 2 things going on testing and finishing our projects. Our team was still putting together our 
rude goldberg project and made progress but it still had problems. We had problems with out stability and some measurements. Other teams were testing there machines
and they went well. I learned some thing about our machine like how the machines interact with eachother. I didnt do the challenge this week since I was absent.
