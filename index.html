     This week was cool we learned about simple machines,
    safety rules, and used tinkercad to 3d design.
    The modeling was full of mixed emotions since I couldn't get the design I wanted
    all the time but it was fun. In the beginning of the week we went over safety rules
    and now I know what is needed to be safe in engineering. Learning about simple machines was 
    interesting too seeing that we use these machines all the time.
    This week was pretty cool.

    This week was short but we did a challenge. The challenge was to make an E and label with measurement.
    Then we would swap papers with someone and trace out their E. Some of the E's in the class were really big but some were small. 
    It was the only major thing we did since the week was short but it was interesting.
