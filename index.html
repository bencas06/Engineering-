    Week 2:This week was cool we learned about simple machines,
    safety rules, and used tinkercad to 3d design.
    The modeling was full of mixed emotions since I couldn't get the design I wanted
    all the time but it was fun. In the beginning of the week we went over safety rules
    and now I know what is needed to be safe in engineering. Learning about simple machines was 
    interesting too seeing that we use these machines all the time.
    This week was pretty cool.

    Week 3:This week was short but we did a challenge. The challenge was to make an E and label with measurement.
    Then we would swap papers with someone and trace out their E. Some of the E's in the class were really big but some were small. 
    It was the only major thing we did since the week was short but it was interesting.

Week 4:This week was spent building our rude goldberg machine. We acomplished a good amount of work. We didnt finish but
we will be finished soon. We also had a challenge this week. The challenge was to make a boat and have it float while having the most weight to win.
We all made our own designs and decided which boat to use. My teams boat did not stay a float for long our lasted for atleast 30 seconds.

Week 5: This week we had 2 things going on testing and finishing our projects. Our team was still putting together our 
rude goldberg project and made progress but it still had problems. We had problems with out stability and some measurements. Other teams were testing there machines
and they went well. I learned some thing about our machine like how the machines interact with eachother. I didnt do the challenge this week since I was absent.

Week 6: This week I learned how to dissect and the assemble a laptop. There was no challenge this week but we had a partner activity dissecting a laptop.
We used the slides to help up dissect the laptop. It was time consuming and at sometimes difficult because some of the screws couldnt come off. I also learned the purpose and location
of some parts in a Laptop such as the gpu and cpu. The hardest part of this activity was putting it all back together. Finding the right screws for the right part was hard such as flat heads or the stars.
We were close to finishing this activity and there was also no challenge.In conclusion I learned the purpose and location of parts and how to disassemble and re assemble a laptop.

Week 7: This week we designed prosthetics and made Peanut Butter Jelly sandwiches.
I learned that it is really crucial for intstructions to be clear and descriptive. 
When we were making sandwiches they turned out bad since the instructions were not clear.
My instructions needed more details like opening the jars and using utensils.
The person that got my instructions made it with their hands. We also designed prosthetics
which was more challenging because we needed to list materials and the functionality of the product.
I made a prosthetic for a bear without a leg.
