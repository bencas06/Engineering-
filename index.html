    Week 2:This week was cool we learned about simple machines,
    safety rules, and used tinkercad to 3d design.
    The modeling was full of mixed emotions since I couldn't get the design I wanted
    all the time but it was fun. In the beginning of the week we went over safety rules
    and now I know what is needed to be safe in engineering. Learning about simple machines was 
    interesting too seeing that we use these machines all the time.
    This week was pretty cool.

    Week 3:This week was short but we did a challenge. The challenge was to make an E and label with measurement.
    Then we would swap papers with someone and trace out their E. Some of the E's in the class were really big but some were small. 
    It was the only major thing we did since the week was short but it was interesting.

Week 4:This week was spent building our rude goldberg machine. We acomplished a good amount of work. We didnt finish but
we will be finished soon. We also had a challenge this week. The challenge was to make a boat and have it float while having the most weight to win.
We all made our own designs and decided which boat to use. My teams boat did not stay a float for long our lasted for atleast 30 seconds.

</p>

<p>
Week 5: This week we had 2 things going on testing and finishing our projects. Our team was still putting together our 
rude goldberg project and made progress but it still had problems. We had problems with out stability and some measurements. Other teams were testing there machines
and they went well. I learned some thing about our machine like how the machines interact with eachother. I didnt do the challenge this week since I was absent.

Week 6: This week I learned how to dissect and the assemble a laptop. There was no challenge this week but we had a partner activity dissecting a laptop.
We used the slides to help up dissect the laptop. It was time consuming and at sometimes difficult because some of the screws couldnt come off. I also learned the purpose and location
of some parts in a Laptop such as the gpu and cpu. The hardest part of this activity was putting it all back together. Finding the right screws for the right part was hard such as flat heads or the stars.
We were close to finishing this activity and there was also no challenge.In conclusion I learned the purpose and location of parts and how to disassemble and re assemble a laptop.

Week 7: This week we designed prosthetics and made Peanut Butter Jelly sandwiches.
I learned that it is really crucial for intstructions to be clear and descriptive. 
When we were making sandwiches they turned out bad since the instructions were not clear.
My instructions needed more details like opening the jars and using utensils.
The person that got my instructions made it with their hands. We also designed prosthetics
which was more challenging because we needed to list materials and the functionality of the product.
I made a prosthetic for a bear without a leg.

Week 8: This week we had a challenge flying paper airplanes and prepared to launch rockets.
The goal of the paper airplanes was to get to the desired location. My airplane failed becauase it couldnt fly straight.
During this week we brainstormed and listed materials for out rocket. We then desgined it on tinkercad. Based off tinkercad 
we chose which rocket would work best. We chose Burkes rocket.

Week 9: This week we built our rockets based off the tinkercad design.
We spent most of the week building. At the end of the week we launched our rockets which was a little bit time consuming.
Our rocket shot and landed a good distance from the starting point. We didnt get the farthest and didnt win the challenge.
But we learned what makes a rocket launch well. When it looks like an airplane.

Week 10: This week we used tinkercad to practice breadboarding. We made cicuits in parralel and series. It started to confuse me with how it worked but I got help from people around me.

<p>
Week 11: This week we focused on electrical engineering. We learned about breadboarding and parralel vs series circuits.We also 
did a worksheet on ohms law. We learned the equations for calculating voltage(v=ir),resistance(r=v/i) and current(i=v/r)
The breadboard lab we used TinkerCad to complete make cicuits in series and parralel. I learned how breadboards and resistors work in a circuit.
During the lab it got a little confusing with the placement of the resistors and led. I learned how to fix the problem with help from people around me.

Week 12: This week we had a challenge, arduino intro, and some multimeter practice.
This week's challenge was about if it would take longer to be in a math class everyday or count to 1 million.
I said it would take longer to count to 1 million than to be in a math class. We had to do the math to prove it and I said it would take it would take around 6 days for a math class 
and 277 days to count to 1 million. We also learned about arduino programming. We only used it to set delays to the lights and alter the colors.
We connected the breadboard to the arduino to accomplish this. During this week I learned how to program using arduino.

Week 13: During this week we had a challenge. The challenge was about wether there are more wheels or doors at the school. I had to defend and prove that there were more wheels than doors at the school.
We went into the quad and parking lot to count all the cars and multiply by 4 to get the wheels. Then we counted every car to get the steering wheels. We also worked on our first prototype of spaghettinbridges on tinkercad.
